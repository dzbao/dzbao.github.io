## Abstract

Project duplication detection is critical for project quality assessment, as it improves resource utilization efficiency by preventing investing in newly proposed project that have already been studied. It requires the ability to understand high-level semantics and generate constructive and valuable feedback. Existing detection methods rely on basic word- or sentence-level comparison or solely apply large language models, lacking valuable insights for experts and in-depth comprehension of project content and detection criteria. To address this, we propose **PD$^3$**, a framework for **P**roject Duplication **D**etection via adapted multi-agent **D**ebate. Inspired by real-world expert debates, PD employs a fair round-robin competition format to guide multi-agent debate to retrieve relevant projects and incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis to improve its feedback practicality. Over 800 real-world power project data spanning 22 specialized fields over three years are used to evaluate the framework, demonstrating 8.34% and 8.00% improvements in precision and accuracy over existing methods in two key tasks. Furthermore, we develop and deploy Review Dingdang, an online platform assisting power experts, which has already saved 5.73 million USD across 118 newly proposed projects.

## Platform - Review Dingdang
